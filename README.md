## 🧠 About

I work on analyzing, testing, and understanding game systems.

I develop and test mods by combining QA, debugging, and technical logic to identify, reproduce, and analyze complex in-game behaviors.

I am particularly interested in interactions between systems (player states, transitions, timing, camera).

## 🔍 System Analysis Example

### ⭐ Camera & Player State Desynchronization

During the development of the **PhoneOnSkate** mod, a complex bug appeared when closing the phone.

The player remained correctly on the skateboard (consistent world state), but the camera became desynchronized and incorrectly switched between first and third person.

👉 This bug involves several systems:

* Player state
* Skateboard object
* Phone interface (UI)
* Camera management

### 📌 Analysis

The issue appears to come from a conflict between the player's state being maintained on the skateboard and the camera behavior when exiting the phone interface.
